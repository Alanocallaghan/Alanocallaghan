I work statistical models for biomedical data, and their applications.
At the moment my focus is on quantifying expression heterogeneity in 
single cell RNAseq data.

I maintain some R packages:
- CRAN packages:
  - [bayefdr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayefdr/index.html)
  - [contrast](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/contrast/index.html)
- Bioc packages:
  - [snifter](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/snifter.html)
  - [densvis](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/densvis.html)
  - [scater](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/scater.html)

I also contribute to:
- CRAN packages:
  - [heatmaply](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heatmaply/index.html)
- Bioc packages:
  - [BASiCS](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/BASiCS.html)


Bioc pkg build statuses:
- [densvis](https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/devel/bioc-LATEST/densvis/)
- [scater](https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/devel/bioc-LATEST/scater/)
- [snifter](https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/devel/bioc-LATEST/snifter/)
